# asteroids

A for fun sandbox implementation of the classic 1945 arcade game. Written in Javascript, HTML5, and canvas. 

Control the ship using WASD, SPACE to shoot, and B to bomb. The bomb can only be used once every 5 seconds.

Most interesting challenge: Wrote a custom library for loading images and for animating sprites. These can be found in sprite.js and resources.js.

Additional things to work on:
  multiple instances of the same audio file playing
  Browser cookie storage for high scores
  Progressive difficulty for levels
  Respawn invincibility
